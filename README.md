# VectorShift: Frontend Technical Assessment

## Overview

This project is a technical assessment implementation that recreates core functionalities of VectorShift's main application. The focus was on building a node-based workflow builder with features like node abstraction, dynamic styling, and backend integration for pipeline validation. The implementation showcases modern web development practices and attention to user experience.

**Frontend:** [Live Site URL](https://vectorshift-task.vercel.app/)

**Code Repo:** [Repository URL](https://github.com/RutamBhagat/vectorshift_task)



## Key Features

- **Node Abstraction**: Implemented a flexible node system supporting various node types (Inputs, Outputs, LLMs, Text)
- **Dynamic Text Node**: Created responsive text nodes with variable parsing and dynamic handle creation
- **Interactive Canvas**: Built using ReactFlow for smooth node-based workflow creation
- **Backend Integration**: FastAPI backend for pipeline validation and DAG verification
- **Modern UI**: Styled using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- **Pipeline Validation**: Real-time feedback on pipeline structure and validity

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: React.js
- **Workflow Builder**: ReactFlow
- **Styling**: 
  - Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
  - shadcn/ui for component library
- **Backend**: FastAPI for Python backend services
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript for enhanced development
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Deployment**: Vercel for frontend hosting

## Implementation Details

### 1. Node Abstraction
- Created a base node abstraction for common functionality
- Implemented specialized node types (Input, Output, LLM, Text)
- Added five custom nodes demonstrating abstraction flexibility

### 2. Text Node Features
- Dynamic resizing based on content
- Variable parsing with {{ variable }} syntax
- Automatic handle creation for parsed variables

### 3. Pipeline Validation
- Backend DAG validation
- Node and edge counting
- User-friendly response display

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

2. **Dynamic Text Nodes**
- Challenge: Handling variable parsing and dynamic handles
- Solution: Created regex-based parser with React state management

3. **Backend Integration**
- Challenge: Validating complex graph structures
- Solution: Implemented efficient DAG validation algorithms

## Optimizations

1. **Performance**
- Optimized ReactFlow rendering
- Efficient state management
- Minimized unnecessary re-renders

2. **Code Quality**
- Modular component architecture
- Reusable styling patterns
- Clear separation of concerns

3. **User Experience**
